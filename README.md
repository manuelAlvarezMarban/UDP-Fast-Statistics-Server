# UDP Fast Statistics Server
Simple UDP Server, for exporting received data traffic statistics to files. Suited for Big Data pipelines or data collectors tests. 

UDP Server for continuos data receiving that exports data traffic statistics each minute to file, allowing fast testing of data
collectors in order to, for instance, facilitate subsequent Apache Kafka or other stream processing system sizing.

The data gathered is: Total (KB|B) received, total messages, maximum message size, mean of messages size, KB received
per minute and per second, messages received per minute and per second.

-This data is wrote in file each minute, but if the server doesnÂ´t receive data, will write nothing until next minute with data, 
taking this into account for calculation of rates.-
